Aaron wants "Something to track initiative order and creature hit points"
"Number of ROunds"
"Spell tracking... buffing nerfing stuff"
"Dire badger lasts how long?"
"I only need to know what weapons and armor they're wearing"
"Two Laptops?"


Track total HP and Active HP
 Mobile app - Players track own stuff
 Mobile app - DM can send msgs to Players
 DM view, Player View
 
Imagery
Object that modifies other objects temporarily
Like blessed modifies defense for # turns

Auto-rolls
make sure everything is optional
like if people want to roll themselves
if people want to create their own character stats etc.
dont bake in random rolls

GUI for usability
    look at DM screens for inspiration
Inventory
Money
Combat - dexterity check to determine place in order of Combat

Story Page:
Browser interface that has small boxes rep-ing each Character
w basic stats, HP, etc. Maybe an avatar
Those basic stats HP, etc. should be editable from Story Page for convenience
Click on box to reveal all attrs
Some other action (check box?) to enter Combat - Need "Combat_active" attr?
Action to remove from story page
Should turn red if HP<0
Do we need a active weapon or available inventory?

DM Mgmt Page:
Shows all Player Characters, previous monsters, NPCs
Action to create new monsters and characters
    This creator page would probably include or also be the editing page
Action to bring them to Story Page - Need "story_active" attr?
Categories: Setting, Characters, etc.

Create/Edit Character Page:
Perhaps all attrs including Inventory and Money,
but with accordion-style Categories, so it's only as busy as you want.
